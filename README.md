# BIITE

This repository contains the code for the BIITE algorithm, which infers peptide:HLA immunogenicity from ELISpot data. 
It can be installed in R using devtools::install_github("liesb/BIITE").
Example data is available in Data; an example script is available in Example/example.r

We have submitted the BIITE paper for submission. Please email me for a reference (I will add one as soon as the paper has been accepted).

Feel free to ask me anything via email!
